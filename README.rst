Skuld_ is a Paxos_ implementation independent of transport medium and selection
algorithm. It uses continuation passing style to allow a driving consensus
implementation to direct the coordination between parties (norns_).

It is currently incomplete, but basics.test.js runs and demonstrates how the
norns can decide wyrd_.

Skuld is made more awesome through the power of Norse mythology.
